A couple of weeks ago, I had a fantastic time speaking and attending [Vue.js Global](https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/), a global online conference held on September 17th and 18th. This article will share my thoughts and experience from attending the conference and some of my takeaways.

Overall, I'll say I had such a good time at the conference, even though it was online and we all miss attending in-person conferences. This one didn't feel so much like that because the community made it come alive. There were so many memorable moments during the conference.

I had the chance to be a part of the Speaker's Dinner a day before the conference, and it was so much fun. You can tell my face is missing from the zoom call, but I was present ðŸ˜‰. We had so much fun playing a Pub Quiz hosted by [Israel Roldan](https://twitter.com/isro_me) (PS: My manager, I'm so proud to be working with him!)

> **TL: DR;**  The conference was so much fun and I took away so many things and looking forward to exploring and using them. 

The conference was a [two-day conference](https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/program) packed with so much goodness and some exciting news everyone was looking forward to... I'm sure you already know what that is but more on that later.

# Conference Day 1 (September 17th)

We kicked off the conference with [Jos Gerards'](https://twitter.com/josgerards88) opening remarks and welcomed both attendees and speakers. I liked many cool things about the conference. I'll share some hints as we go on, and you can also [let me know if you feel the same way](https://twitter.com/lauragift_).

Our hosts for the conference were [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/MariaLamardo) and [Ben Hong](https://twitter.com/bencodezen) and they took over with **speaker** **introductions** and **QnA Moderation**. I must say they both did a fantastic job pulling together and keeping everyone hyped for two days. That's no easy task, not that I've hosted a conference before, but I can tell it must have taken a lot of work to pull it off.

**Here's a rundown of some talks I attended from the first day of the conference. Watch out for yours truly!**

[Tim's](https://twitter.com/timbenniks) talk was one of the best in terms of delivery...he went all out on this one and made us all look like amateurs! His talk covered Vite and Vitepress, and it was an excellent introduction to Vite for me personally. I've never used it in a project. I only remember when it was released, and it was nice to see how Vite and Vitepress works from scratch.

I gave a talk, and it covered an introduction to Gridsome and the possibilities of what you can achieve with the Jamstack. I showed how you could also extend the functionalities of a Gridsome Application by leveraging the API's it ships with. At this point, technical difficulties set in, and I wasn't able to complete my talk(it was prerecorded, and the video was skipping). No worries though, I have a link to [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lauragift21/jamstack-ftw-static-site-generation-with-gridsome) and the recording if you missed it or want to see the full version of the [talk on my channel](https://youtu.be/E3kyCodVVOM).

She mentioned something I think I needed to pay attention to because we have so many options to choose from, doesn't mean you have to use every tool in your application but instead think from the performance perspective. So asking the question does adding all of these services make my app more performant?

# Conference Day 2 (September 18th)

The second day of the conference kicked off with the organizer Jos Gerards welcoming attendees back for another day of great content. The talks for the day were all packed with news and great content in the Vue community.

### The State of Vue 3 featuring Evan You's Announcement

This was one of the sessions we've been waiting for and anticipating to hear what news [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) had for us in his Keynote, which streamed live. I guessed right on this one, and I was right.

[Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) **"One Piece"** was released on September 18th at 4:45 pm(WAT). I even got the time right; that's to show you how excited I was! You can watch the recording directly. I want to say I appreciate the work that went into the release of Vue 3 when Evan shared the journey to Vue 3. It took two years of active development to get this out the door so thank you to every member of the Core Team and Community doing the excellent work of contributing to make Vue the fantastic framework that it is.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp5ANvd88x0>

Following the announcement, there was a live QnA session where some members of the community and Panel got to ask Evan some questions. It was so good and nicely put together.

### After Party and Community Connections

Well, after the talks ended for the conference, you'd think it was the end of the conference since it's online and there's no physical after party. That was not the case for us. We had a great time during the conference, yes but still had many people hanging around waiting for the after-party! ðŸŽ‰

Jos Gerards played some lovely music. We even had a conference Spotify Playlist where people can add cool songs from where their locations. I liked that the [Hopin](https://hopin.to/) platform had almost the same experience you'll get from attending an in-person conference. I checked out the Sponsors Booth and did a couple of networking with some attendees for me. This was one of the things I appreciated about the conference. The chat was so lively, and everyone was excited, and you could feel it from wherever you're connected from around the world.

# Takeaways and What I'm looking forward to next time!
