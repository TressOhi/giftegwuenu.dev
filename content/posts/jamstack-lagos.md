I‚Äôm still amazed we were able to pull off a great event. This past weekend, We organized the first ever JAMstack meetup in Lagos and it was a huge success. The [JAMstack community](https://jamstack.org/community/) has been springing up in different parts of the world and being an enthusiast I was already having FOMO from all the events I‚Äôve been seeing on the internet including the [JAMstack Conference](https://jamstackconf.com/). So I made the decision to start a meetup in Lagos Nigeria, alongside my Co-Organizer [William Imoh](https://twitter.com/iChuloo). We started making plans for the first event scheduled to hold May 4th.

## Planning The Event

I already had an idea of organizing and planning events since I had hosted a meetup before. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pull this off without the help of William Imoh of course. We had to lock down dates, event theme, speakers, venue, and sponsors. Thanks to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for giving me the first nudge they sponsored our meetup page subscription which I couldn‚Äôt afford at the time. We also had a couple of sponsors that made this event successful. [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com), an Image Management Platform and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), a Cloud Communications Platform also sponsored this event in some way and we are thankful for that.

## Lightning Talks

We also had two lightning talks from Prosper Otemuyiwa. The first talk was about JAMstack API‚Äôs. Here Prosper demystified the A in JAMstack. He gave super useful examples of API we can leverage when building with the JAMstack. [You can find his slides here.](https://speakerdeck.com/unicodeveloper/lightning-talk-jamstack)

After Obinna‚Äôs talk, Prosper gave us his second lightning talk about ways we can engineer faster web experiences in plain sight. He dropped tips and tricks on how we can build fast loading experiences for users on the web.

The last agenda we had for the day was a closing remark by William Imoh. He talked about each of our sponsors [Twilio](http://twilio.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com) and the services they provide. We also had 3 minutes slots for anyone that has something to pitch to the audience this is inclusive of job opportunities, ideas and a chance to advertise your startup like Prosper and I did.
That brought us to the end of the event. We spent the remaining time networking and also we had stickers, food, and drinks for the guests.

## Conclusion

I was really excited to see a small idea I had spring up into something successful and it gladdens my heart. I wouldn‚Äôt have done this alone so thanks to My OG [William Imoh](https://twitter.com/iChuloo), [Prosper Otemuyiwa](https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper) and [Perry Eising](https://twitter.com/perrysetgo) from Netlify. We hope to continue having more events over the next couple of months so keep your tabs open so you don‚Äôt miss out. JAMstack is the future and we don‚Äôt want anyone missing out on that train. Till next time! üëã
